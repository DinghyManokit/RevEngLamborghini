# Lamborghini Resource Repo

## Project Overview

This project aims to create a resource for anyone who is willing to work on a lamborghini by collecting and providing resources from across the web and reverse engineering various components that are difficult to find.

## Goals
- Make maintenance and repairs less intimidating for owners.
- Provide alternate avenues for replacement parts to reduce costs and downtime.
- Create a knowledge base for current and future owners.

## Current State As Of Feb 26. 2026
